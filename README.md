# Chai Aur Cohort 26

**Chai Aur Cohort** is a full-stack web development program by **Hitesh Choudhary** and **Piyush Garg**.  
This repository documents my **in-depth learning journey**, covering everything from **core fundamentals** to **advanced full-stack concepts**.

The goal of this repo is not just to complete assignments, but to **deeply understand how the web works** and build a strong foundation as a developer.
